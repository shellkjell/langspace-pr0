# LangSpace Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the LangSpace project.

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

### Core Features
- ✅ Basic entity system with File and Agent types
- ✅ Efficient parser with error reporting
- ✅ Workspace management for entities
- ✅ Token pooling for memory optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Basic parser implementation
- ✅ Simple workspace management
- ⚠️ Partial error reporting
- ⚠️ Limited test coverage

### Recent Improvements
- ✅ Enhanced parser performance
- ✅ Improved error messages with line/position info
- ✅ Multi-line string support
- ✅ Entity type registry
- ✅ Memory optimization via token pooling


### Known Issues
- ❌ Go version requirement inconsistency (documentation states 1.23)
