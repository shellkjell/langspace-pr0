## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, ensure you have:

1. **API Keys** configured as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"  # Optional, for multi-model examples
   ```

2. **MCP Servers** installed (for tool-using examples):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic/mcp-git
   npm install -g @anthropic/mcp-filesystem
   ```

3. **LangSpace CLI** installed:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/shellkjell/langspace/cmd/langspace@latest
   ```

## Running Examples

```bash
# Run a specific intent
langspace run examples/advanced/01-autonomous-research-agent.ls research "quantum computing applications"

# Execute a pipeline
langspace run examples/advanced/02-multi-agent-software-factory.ls --pipeline develop-feature --input spec.md

# Start trigger listeners (for event-driven examples)
langspace serve examples/advanced/05-continuous-monitoring.ls

# Compile to Python for integration
langspace compile --target python examples/advanced/03-intelligent-data-pipeline.ls
```

## Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Agent Specialization
Each example demonstrates agents with focused responsibilities, enabling:
- Better performance through specialized instructions
- Easier debugging and iteration
- Modular composition

### 2. Pipeline Orchestration
Complex workflows are broken into discrete steps with:
- Clear data flow between stages
- Parallel execution where dependencies allow
- Conditional branching based on intermediate results

### 3. Script-First Efficiency
Heavy data operations use scripts instead of tool calls:
- Minimal context window usage
- Atomic multi-step operations
- Sandboxed execution

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
Triggers enable:
- Real-time response to external events
- Scheduled batch processing
- Integration with existing systems

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the simplest example** that matches your use case
2. **Customize the agents** with domain-specific instructions
3. **Add tools gradually** — start with built-ins, then add MCP
4. **Use scripts for data-heavy operations** to minimize costs
5. **Implement proper error handling** with on_error handlers
6. **Test incrementally** using the individual intent invocations
