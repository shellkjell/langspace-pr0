# Workspace Package

The `workspace` package manages LangSpace workspaces, providing entity storage, querying, and lifecycle management. It serves as the runtime environment for LangSpace entities.

## Overview

A workspace is responsible for:
- Entity storage and retrieval
- Entity relationship management
- Operation execution
- State management

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/shellkjell/langspace/pkg/workspace"

// Create a new workspace
ws := workspace.New()

// Add entities
err := ws.AddEntity(entity)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Query entities
files := ws.GetEntitiesByType("file")
for _, file := range files {
    fmt.Printf("File: %s\n", file.Properties()[0])
}
```

## Features

### Entity Management
- Add/Remove entities
- Query by type or property
- Relationship tracking
- Validation on addition

### Operations
- File system operations
- Agent task execution
- Entity modifications
- State persistence

### Event System
- Entity lifecycle events
- Operation completion events
- Error events
- State change notifications

## Best Practices

- Initialize workspace at startup
- Handle workspace errors appropriately
- Clean up resources when done
- Use appropriate query methods

## State Management

The workspace maintains:
- Active entities
- Operation status
- Entity relationships
- Resource usage

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Workspace persistence
- Multi-workspace support
- Enhanced query capabilities
- Resource quotas
- Operation scheduling
