# Performance Analysis

This document outlines the performance characteristics of the LangSpace parser and entity system.

## Parser Performance

### Small Input Performance (3 entities)
- **Time**: ~1.9 microseconds per operation
- **Memory**: 280 bytes allocated per operation
- **Allocations**: 12 allocations per operation

### Large Input Performance (200 entities)
- **Time**: ~137 microseconds per operation
- **Memory**: 20.5 KB allocated per operation
- **Allocations**: 609 allocations per operation

### Performance Characteristics
- Linear scaling with input size (~0.7 microseconds per entity)
- Memory usage scales linearly (~100 bytes per entity)
- Allocation count scales linearly (~3 allocations per entity)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Token Pool
- Implemented a global token pool to reduce memory allocations
- Tokens are reused across parsing operations
- Reduces GC pressure and memory fragmentation

### 2. Streamlined Parser
- Single-pass parsing without intermediate token stream
- Direct string parsing with minimal allocations
- Efficient error reporting with line and position tracking

### 3. Entity System
- Efficient entity type registry
- Zero-copy string handling where possible
- Minimal interface overhead

## Areas for Future Optimization

### 1. Memory Usage
- Consider using a string intern pool for common strings
- Investigate reducing per-entity allocation overhead
- Profile memory usage patterns under heavy load

### 2. Parser Performance
- Consider parallel parsing for very large inputs
- Investigate preallocating common data structures
- Profile hot paths for potential micro-optimizations

### 3. Entity System
- Consider adding entity pooling for common entity types
- Investigate lazy initialization patterns
- Profile entity creation and destruction patterns

## Benchmarking Methodology

All benchmarks were run using Go's built-in testing framework with the following conditions:
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
- OS: Windows
- Go Version: latest stable
- Each benchmark runs multiple iterations to ensure statistical significance
- Memory statistics include both heap allocations and system overhead

## Performance Guidelines

When working with the LangSpace parser and entity system, consider these guidelines:

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Process multiple entities in a single Parse() call when possible
   - Reuse parser instances for multiple operations

2. **Memory Management**
   - Release entities when no longer needed
   - Use the token pool for custom token handling
   - Consider the entity lifecycle in long-running operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Error reporting includes line and position information
   - Error handling has minimal performance impact
   - Consider error recovery for large batch operations
