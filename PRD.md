# Product Requirements Document for langspace

## Overview

langspace is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to provide a simple and intuitive way to declare and manipulate various entities within a virtual workspace. The language is intended to enable users to automate tasks and manage entities within their virtual environment.

## Functional Requirements

### Entity Management

* File Management - langspace should allow users to declare and manage files within the virtual workspace. This includes:
  * Creating new files with specified contents.
  * Updating existing files with new contents.
  * Deleting existing files.
* Agent Management - langspace should allow users to declare and manage agents within the virtual workspace. This includes:
  * Creating new agents with specified instructions.
  * Updating existing agents with new instructions.
  * Deleting existing agents.
* Task Management - langspace should allow users to declare and manage tasks within the virtual workspace. This includes:
  * Creating new tasks with specified instructions.
  * Updating existing tasks with new instructions.
  * Deleting existing tasks.

### Automation

* Task Automation - langspace should allow users to automate tasks within the virtual workspace. This includes:
  * Specifying instructions for tasks.
  * Executing tasks automatically based on user-defined triggers.
* Agent Automation - langspace should allow users to automate agent interactions within the virtual workspace. This includes:
  * Specifying instructions for agents.
  * Executing agent instructions automatically based on user-defined triggers.

### Declarative Syntax

* Declarative Syntax - langspace should use a declarative syntax to define entities and their relationships within the virtual workspace.
* Entity Relationships - langspace should allow users to define relationships between entities, such as file-agent-task relationships.

### Miscellaneous

* Error Handling - langspace should provide robust error handling mechanisms to handle invalid user input, entity management errors, and automation errors.
* Security - langspace should provide adequate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to entities and automation functionality.

### Non-Functional Assumptions

* This PRD assumes that the langspace language will be used in a virtual workspace environment.
* This PRD assumes that the langspace language will be used by users who have a basic understanding of programming concepts.

### Example Usage

The example usage provided demonstrates how to use langspace to declare a file and an agent. Additional examples will be needed to demonstrate the full range of langspace features and functionality.
